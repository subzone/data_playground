## Development Process

1. **Sprint Planning**: Begin each sprint with a planning session to define goals and tasks.

2. **Daily Stand-ups**: Conduct daily team meetings to discuss progress and blockers.

3. **Agile Development**: 
   - Use short sprints (e.g., 2 weeks) for iterative development
   - Regularly refine and reprioritize the backlog

4. **Code Review Process**: 
   - All code changes go through peer review before merging
   - Use pull requests for code reviews

5. **Continuous Integration**: 
   - Automatically run tests on each commit
   - Enforce code quality checks (e.g., linting, static analysis)

6. **Continuous Deployment**: 
   - Automate deployment to staging environment for each successful build
   - Implement blue-green or canary deployment strategies for production

7. **Regular Demos**: 
   - Conduct demo sessions at the end of each sprint
   - Gather feedback from stakeholders

8. **Retrospectives**: 
   - Hold team retrospectives to discuss what went well and areas for improvement
   - Implement actionable improvements in subsequent sprints

9. **Documentation**: 
   - Update documentation continuously throughout the development process
   - Ensure all new features and changes are properly documented

10. **Security Reviews**: 
    - Conduct regular security audits
    - Address security concerns as high-priority items

11. **Performance Monitoring**: 
    - Continuously monitor system performance
    - Address performance issues proactively

This implementation plan and development process provide a structured approach to building out the full system based on our proof of concept. It covers all aspects of the software development lifecycle, from initial setup to continuous improvement in production.
